## About
A friend recently told me that I am good at writing about my feelings and I should do so on a more formal scale. I didn't want to expose myself on the internet but I thought that seeing how someone else feels could bring a sense of relatablity to people and some may find my life interesting - I do hope I don't end up getting stalked.
